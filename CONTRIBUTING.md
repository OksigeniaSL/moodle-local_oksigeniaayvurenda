# Contributing to local_oksigeniaayvurenda

Thanks for taking the time. Ayvurenda is in pre-alpha and changes fast; open an issue before a large PR so we can agree on
the approach.

## Code style

- PHP follows the Moodle Coding Style: <https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle>.
- License header: GPL v3 or later, copyright `Oksigenia SL <dev@oksigenia.cc>`.
- Code, comments and commit messages in **English**. Lang files carry the localised strings.
- No commit message carries the signature of an AI tool. Turn on the hook once in your clone:
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; CI checks the new commits too.
- The code must run on every supported Moodle branch (4.5 to 5.3) and on PHP 8.1.

## Translations

Translations go through **AMOS**, Moodle's translation tool, at <https://lang.moodle.org> once the plugin is on
the Moodle Marketplace. GitHub PRs are for the English strings and for fixes.

## Tests

GitHub Actions runs `moodle-plugin-ci` (validate, lint, code checker, PHPDoc, savepoints, PHPUnit and Behat), a
secret scan (Gitleaks) and the check of commit messages. To run
the PHPUnit tests on your own site:

```bash
php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite local_oksigeniaayvurenda_testsuite
```

## Pull requests

- One topic per PR. Mixed feature + refactor PRs get split before review.
- Reference an issue when one exists.
- Keep diffs small. If the PR stores anything new about users, update the privacy provider and its tests in the
  same PR.
- Bump `version.php` and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry when the change reaches users.

## Sponsored development

Organisations can fund features or a connector to their platform. Funded work is released under the same licence,
GPL v3 or later, and is available to everyone who uses Ayvurenda. It joins the plugin when it serves every library;
what only one platform needs goes into an optional connector. Oksigenia, as maintainer, decides how it fits. Write to
`dev@oksigenia.cc`.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with: plugin version, Moodle version, PHP version, theme, browser, and a minimal reproduction.

## License

By contributing you agree your changes are licensed under GPL v3 or later, the same license as the plugin.
